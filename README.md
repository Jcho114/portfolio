### Description

Personal website made in SvelteKit.

### Motive

I made my previous website over a year ago, and I'll be honest, it wasn't that great. It was my first semester at UMD, and I barely coded before then.

### Tech Stack

I chose to use SvelteKit for this website since I've heard a lot about it recently. I wanted to try it in a rather small project, sort of like a canary project.

The website is currently solely frontend, but I might dabble with the backend if I want some reps hooking APIs on SvelteKit.
